# CRUD-Project
Second project for UDD's Bootcamp. Here I develop a CRUD app for storing and managing different users of my landing page. This is my first time using JavaSript.
Also, it is safe to point out that this entire project was reconstructed since I lost all my data one week before the deadline because my Mac's hardrive got corrupted. For this reason I had to adapt to Windows commands but no biggie.
